2. `securin_assignment.py`: Python script containing the solution to the assessment problem.
3. `Quest-1_2_3.png`: Screenshot of the output displaying the solution to Questions 1, 2, and 3 along with logic and explanation as needed.
4. `Quest-4.png`: Screenshot of the output displaying the solution to Question 4.

## Usage

To use the Python script (`securin_assignment.py`), make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can run the script using the following command:

```bash
python securin_assignment.py
```

This will execute the script and display the output. Make sure to provide any necessary inputs as required by the script.

## Description

The `securin_assignment.py` script contains the solution to the assessment problem provided. It includes functions to calculate total combinations, distribution of possible combinations, probabilities of sums, and a function to undoom the dice as per the specified conditions.

## Screenshots

The screenshots (`Quest-1_2_3.png` and `Quest-4.png`) provide visual confirmation of the script's output.

# Doomed Dice Challenge
The Doomed Dice Challenge is a programming challenge that involves solving a problem related to dice probabilities. In this challenge, we are given two six-sided dice, Die A and Die B, and we need to perform several tasks involving probability calculations and dice manipulation.

## Problem Statement
The problem consists of two parts:

### Part A:
Calculate the total number of possible combinations when rolling both Die A and Die B together.
Calculate and display the distribution of all possible combinations.
Calculate the probability of each possible sum occurring.

### Part B:
Adjust Die A to maintain the same probabilities while ensuring that no face has more than 4 spots.
Implement a transformation function to re-attach spots to Die A and Die B, ensuring that the probabilities of obtaining each sum remain unchanged.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

## Standard libraries: math, collections
